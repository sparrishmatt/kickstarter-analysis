# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze data on kickstarter campaigns to uncover trends. Specifically, the goal was to find information relating to kickstarters for theatrical plays. Some of the specific elements that will be looked at are funding goals and the month that these kickstarters were held.
## Project Analysis
This analysis was performed entirely in Excel and had a large focus on how launch date and the original funding goals have an effect on the success of a kickstarter. One of the specific challenges that came from this project was the size of the dataset and some of the formatting that was involved. Some of the work could provide real difficulty to somebody inexperienced in Excel. In this dataset, *plays* are a subcategory of the category *theater*. Let's take a look at the outcomes of the theater category to get a start on understanding the data. 

### Parent Category: *Theater*

It is clear that a majority of the theater kickstarters were successful, with 839 out of 1393 total kickstarters being successful which is around 60%. This can give us some ideas of what to expect for kickstarters based around plays, but we can never know for sure until we take a closer look.

#### Subcategory: *Plays*

While it might be hard to tell from the chart, plays had a higher successful funding percentage than the theater category at about 66% of the 985 total plays. This is a closer view of what to expect when running a kickstarter for a play, but it is still possible to look more in depth at certain elements that could have an effect. 

### Theater Kickstarters: Launch Date?

Does the month that a theater kickstarter launched in have an effect on the outcome of the kickstarter? If we had this information we could use it to determine the best possible month or months to try and launch a successful kickstarter. Fortunately, we do have this information and will be making use of it.

What can be gathered from this? Clearly May is the month with the most successful kickstarters as well as the largest gap between successful and failed kickstarters. If a wider time range were required then it also seems that the period from April to August generally had high levels of success and a large gap between success and failure. May should be the goal month for launching a successful theater kickstarter if at all possible. 

### Setting a Funding Goal

The next thing to be done is finding out which funding range is most likely to yield success for this kickstarter project.

This shows that the outcomes of kickstarters that set smaller goals are more likely to be successful as opposed to those with higher goals, especially starting in the 15,000 to 19,999 range. There are also far less kickstarter campaigns with very high goals being set, which explains the wild shifting as the chart progresses. Using this knowledge along with the insight from above, it can be concluded that the best possible way to run a successful theatre based kickstarter to create a play would be to hold the kickstarter in May and to preferably keep the funding goal below the $5,000 mark if at all possible.
