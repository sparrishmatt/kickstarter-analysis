# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze data on kickstarter campaigns to uncover trends. Specifically, the goal was to find information relating to kickstarters for theatrical plays. Some of the specific elements that will be looked at are funding goals and the month that these kickstarters were held.
## Project Analysis
This analysis was performed entirely in Excel and had a large focus on how launch date and the orginal funding goals have an effect on the success of a kickstarter. In this dataset, *plays* are a subcategory of the category *theater*. Let's take a look at the outcomes of the theater category to get a start on understanding the data.
